It's stage 1 in your PHP language learning journey

project (6) : Even / Odd Counter

Create a PHP program that allows the user to enter a number N, then:

    Count how many even numbers exist from 1 to N  
    Count how many odd numbers exist from 1 to N
    Display both results clearly on the page

Requirements:

    Use an HTML form with GET
    Use a loop (for or while)
    Use functions
    Validate input using isset
    Handle edge cases (0, negative numbers)

Example

    Input:
    N = 10
    ---------
    Output:
    Even numbers count: 5
    Odd numbers count: 5
